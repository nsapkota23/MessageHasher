# Python Hashing Example

## Overview
This Python script demonstrates the process of hashing a message using the `hashlib` library. Hashing is commonly used for data security, password storage, and ensuring data integrity.

## Features
1. **Message Input**: The program prompts the user to enter a message that they want to encode.

2. **MD5 Hashing**: The entered message is encoded and hashed using the MD5 algorithm, which is relatively weak.

3. **SHA-2 Hashing**: The script then demonstrates the use of stronger SHA-2 family algorithms, including SHA-256 and SHA-512.

## Usage
1. **Getting Started**: Run the script to start the hashing process.

2. **Enter a Message**: The program will prompt you to enter a message that you want to encode.

3. **MD5 Hashing**: The script will hash the message using the MD5 algorithm and display the resulting hash as a hexadecimal string.

4. **SHA-2 Hashing**: The script will also demonstrate the use of stronger SHA-2 family algorithms, displaying the SHA-256 and SHA-512 hashes for the input message.

## Running the Script
Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can execute the Python script to run the hashing example.
